I am Koshik Debanath, a Computer Science graduate from Rajshahi University of Engineering \& Technology, Bangladesh. Over the last few years, I have gathered a strong interest in artificial intelligence, especially in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. With multiple peer-reviewed publications, deep industry exposure, and a growing desire to contribute meaningful solutions to real-world problems, I now seek to pursue a PhD to deepen my research capabilities and expand the impact of my work.

My research journey began with a personal turning point --- an ACL injury I experienced during my undergraduate years. While undergoing treatment and rehabilitation, I became curious about how medical imaging and AI could be used together to assist diagnosis. This experience inspired my first research project, where I developed an attention-based deep learning model to classify knee injuries from MRI scans. I served as the first author on this work, which was later accepted at the \textit{ICCIT 2023} conference. That experience not only grounded my technical learning but also showed me how AI can make a real difference in people’s lives.

Motivated by that, I continued to explore diverse topics in AI. I am the first author of two more accepted papers: one on low-resource NLP using \textit{LLaMA} for Bengali question answering, and another that uses machine learning to analyze bot activity and misinformation in the context of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. In addition to those, I have contributed as a second author to several other research efforts --- including Bengali language classification using multilingual \textit{BERT} and a study on AI vs human-written text using explainable models. All of these papers have been accepted at reputable conferences like \textit{ECCE 2025} and \textit{NCIM 2025}.

Beyond academia, I’ve worked remotely as a Data Scientist at Manaknightdigital Inc. in Canada, where I applied Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world systems. I’ve built financial chatbots with RAG, fraud detection models, image-based appraisal platforms using \textit{CLIP}, and a multimodal tender-matching system powered by \textit{LLaMA-2} and \textit{GPT-4}. More recently, I joined Universal Machine Inc. as a Software Engineer, where I’m building an AI-enhanced YouTube Live bot and Chrome extension. These projects have strengthened my understanding of both research and production-level deployment.

My core research interests lie in developing robust and interpretable language models, especially for low-resource languages and misinformation detection. I am also intrigued by cross-modal systems that combine text, image, and user context --- something I’ve touched on in both academic and industry work. I want my research to contribute to open-source tools and practical systems that serve both technical and social goals.

% !!! IMPORTANT REMINDER FROM PREVIOUS REVIEW !!!
% THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED TO ADD THE CUSTOMIZED PARAGRAPH FOR EACH UNIVERSITY/PROGRAM.
% Explain:
% - Why THIS specific program/university?
% - Which professor(s) you want to work with and WHY (mention their specific research).
% - How your background aligns with their work.
% - What specific resources/labs/courses at the university attract you.
%
% Example placeholder:
% I am particularly drawn to the PhD program at [University Name] because of its renowned research in [Specific Area like NLP or Ethical AI]. Professor [Professor's Name]'s work on [mention specific project/paper] deeply aligns with my interests in [your interest, e.g., low-resource NLP]. My experience with [your relevant experience, e.g., LLaMA for Bengali] would allow me to contribute effectively to their ongoing projects, such as [mention another of their projects or a potential future direction]. Furthermore, the [Specific Lab/Center/Initiative at the University] offers an exciting environment for collaborative research.
% (END OF CUSTOMIZATION SECTION)

Looking ahead, I see a PhD as the natural next step --- one that will allow me to focus deeply on problem-solving, explore emerging AI methods, and collaborate with world-class researchers. I’m particularly drawn to labs that support open innovation and work on NLP, ethical AI, and applied machine learning.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your research group.

Sincerely,
