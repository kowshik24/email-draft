Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Power System Dynamics

Abstract. The stability of modern power grids is paramount, yet they
are increasingly vulnerable to dynamic disturbances. While data-driven
machine learning models are powerful, they often lack interpretability
and require vast labeled fault data. This paper proposes a novel frame-
work for real-time anomaly detection using Physics-Informed Neural Net-
works (PINNs). Our approach embeds the governing differential equation
of power system dynamics—the swing equation—directly into the neu-
ral network’s loss function. We demonstrate that a standard PINN ar-
chitecture fails to capture the system’s oscillatory nature and introduce
a stabilized training methodology incorporating Fourier Feature Map-
ping and loss weight annealing to overcome this. By training the model
on sparse data from only normal operating conditions, our framework
accurately reconstructs the system’s state and uses the physics resid-
ual as a robust, interpretable anomaly signal. Experimental results on
a simulated Single-Machine Infinite Bus system show that our method
instantaneously detects fault conditions with high precision. A compara-
tive analysis with an LSTM-based model highlights the PINN’s superior
signal clarity and interpretability. This work presents a data-efficient and
physically-grounded solution for next-generation smart grid monitoring,
validated against a common data-driven approach.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented an effective framework for real-time anomaly
detection in power systems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks. By embed-
ding the governing swing equation into the network’s training, our model learns
the fundamental dynamics of the system from extremely sparse data representing
only normal operation. We demonstrated the necessity of a stabilized training
approach, incorporating Fourier Feature Mapping and loss weight annealing, to
successfully model the system’s oscillatory behavior. The key result is the use of
the physics residual as a robust, interpretable, and instantaneous anomaly signal,
achieving a detection SNR of over 44 dB. This approach overcomes the major
limitations of purely data-driven methods by being exceptionally data-efficient
and physically grounded, representing a significant step towards building more
intelligent and reliable monitoring systems for the future Smart Grid. Future
work will focus on extending this framework to more complex, multi-machine
power systems and validating it on real-world PMU data.
