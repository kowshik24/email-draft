Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Parameter Inference and Uncertainty Quantification in Reaction-Diffusion Models of Wound Healing

Abstract
Predictive mathematical models of biological processes like wound healing are essential for quantitative understanding, but their clinical utility is often limited by a critical roadblock: uncertainty in their biophysical parameters. These parameters are difficult to measure directly and must be inferred from sparse, noisy data. This paper presents a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework to address this challenge by performing robust parameter inference and principled uncertainty quantification. We frame the identification of unknown parameters in a coupled reaction-diffusion system for wound healing as a Bayesian inverse problem. By integrating sparse obser- vational data with the governing physical laws within a variational inference framework, the BPINN learns the full posterior distributions of unknown model parameters. Our results show that the framework accurately infers key reaction parameters from a dataset comprising less than 0.01% of the full spatio-temporal domain. More importantly, the BPINN correctly di- agnoses that the cell motility parameter is practically non-identifiable from the sparse data, a conclusion supported by the large posterior uncertainty it assigns. The model’s predictive uncertainty is well-calibrated, being high- est in regions far from observations. This work establishes the dual value of BPINNs as a powerful computational tool: both for developing reliable, personalized biomechanical models through data-driven calibration, and for diagnosing parameter identifiability issues—a critical step towards building trustworthy models in computational medicine and systems biology.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have utilized a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network framework to address the challenging inverse problem of parameter
inference in a PDE-based model of wound healing dynamics. By treating
this as a Bayesian inference problem, our approach successfully moves beyond deterministic point estimates to provide full posterior distributions for
unknown biophysical parameters and principled uncertainty quantification
for model predictions.
Our results demonstrate the dual strengths of this methodology for mathematical biology. First, the BPINN framework proved capable of accurately
inferring the key reaction parameters of the model from a dataset that was
both extremely sparse and corrupted by noise. This highlights its potential
as a powerful tool for calibrating complex biological models against realistic
experimental data. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the framework
correctly diagnosed a practical non-identifiability issue with the cell motility
parameter. Instead of converging to a wrong value with false confidence, the
BPINN assigned a large, honest uncertainty to this parameter, effectively
flagging it as unresolvable from the given data. This diagnostic capability is
invaluable for building robust and trustworthy models, preventing the propagation of unacknowledged parameter uncertainty into clinical or scientific
conclusions.
The well-calibrated predictive uncertainty, which was shown to be lowest
near data points and highest in unexplored regions of the domain, further
underscores the reliability of the approach. By providing not just a prediction but also a measure of confidence, BPINNs can guide future experimental
design. This work establishes BPINNs as a sophisticated and practical tool
for the computational sciences, with significant potential to advance the development of personalized and predictive models in biology and medicine.
