Analyzing Bot Activity and Political Discourse in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Machine Learning Approach to Misinformation and Manipulation

Abstract—Social media has become a battleground for political
discourse, with automated accounts (bots) playing a growing role
in shaping public opinion and engagement. In the context of
the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, understanding bot activity is
crucial for identifying potential misinformation and manipulation
tactics. This study analyzes 50,191 tweets collected between
May and July 2023 to assess bot prevalence and influence. Bot
detection is conducted using Botometer API scores and a Random
Forest Regressor (MSE: 0.0071, R²: 0.779), facilitating a multi-
threshold analysis. Findings indicate a low overall bot presence
(2.22% at a 0.7 threshold) but significant variations across
political affiliations. While human-generated content dominates
with a 15:1 engagement ratio, bots are most effective in cross-
party discussions (engagement ratio: 0.145), whereas Democratic-
focused bots exhibit the lowest engagement success. To deepen
insights into election-related influence operations, a novel party-
affiliation analysis framework is introduced, shedding light on
platform-specific manipulation strategies and their implications
for political discourse.

Conclusion:
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of
bot activity during the 2024 US presidential election, reveal-
ing evolving strategies in computational propaganda. While
overall bot prevalence declined significantly from 2016 levels
(2.22% vs. 9.7%), their targeted deployment in cross-party and
Democratic-aligned discourse demonstrates persistent attempts
to exploit political polarization. The stark engagement dis-
parity (15:1 human-to-bot ratio) confirms limited persuasive
impact but highlights bots’ role in agenda-setting through
amplification. Methodologically, the hybrid detection frame-
work—combining Botometer API verification with machine
learning refinement proved robust, at the 0.7 threshold. The de-
velopment of party-normalized engagement metrics addressed
critical gaps in contextual impact assessment, revealing previ-
ously obscured micro-targeting patterns.
These findings carry urgent implications for election in-
tegrity frameworks. While platform policies have reduced bot
prevalence, their strategic adaptation to polarized environ-
ments necessitates continuous monitoring. Future work should
integrate multi-modal detection (text + image analysis) and
real-time threshold adjustment to counter evolving tactics. As
democracies grapple with AI-driven disinformation, this study
establishes critical benchmarks for detecting and mitigating
automated influence in electoral processes
Our analysis reveals evolving bot tactics in the 2024 elec-
tion discourse, particularly in cross-party engagement. While
overall bot prevalence remains low (2.22%), their strategic
deployment in specific contexts suggests sophisticated tar-
geting. The demonstrated 15:1 engagement disparity favors
human content, but high cross-party bot effectiveness warrants
monitoring. Limitations are analysis limited to a single plat-
form, potential bias in keyword-based party affiliation, limited
timeframe of data collection.
